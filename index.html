<p><span class="fl">M</span>inlib is a small, fast library
management program with broad customization features, zero
impact on the underlying file system, Unicode awareness
(specifically, UTF-8), automatic extraction of metadata from
a wide array of different file types, both a command-line
and a screen-oriented text user interface (TUI), and
full-text regular-expression searches of the entire library
database from within the program.</p>

<p>On a more technical level, minlib is written in
POSIX-compliant C.  It uses GNU libextractor for the
metadata extraction, except for pdf and epub; pdf uses
pdfinfo, assuming it is installed on the system, while the
epub metadata extraction uses unzip and is otherwise
home-rolled.  Its TUI is designed using ncurses.  As a
result, it is very fast and very small.</p>

<p>Minlib strives to adhere to the general Unix philosophy
of <em>do one thing and do it well</em>; it further goes out
of its way to <em>never assume it knows better than the
user</em>.  Consequently, it attempts to do its job and get
out of the user's way.  Judgements about its success or
failure at this must be deferred, of course, to the
user.</p>

<p>What minlib is <em>not</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minlib is <em>not</em> a file viewer.  It simply makes
your files easy to find, arrange, and view with the other
file viewers you already have.  You likely already have a
favorite ebook reader; pdf viewer; web browser; and the
like; why should minlib attempt to replace any or all of
them? Rather, minlib makes it easy to find your files and
view them with the viewers you choose.</li>
<li>Minlib is <em>not</em> a file format converter.  There
are tons of those out there already.  Minlib makes it easy
for you to use those format converters and their results in
your library; but it doesn't attempt to replace them.</li>
<li>Minlib does <em>not</em> trounce your filesystem, read
your email, spam your newsgroups, contact the mothership, or
phone home in any other way.  It does what <em>you</em>
want, as best as it can.</li>
