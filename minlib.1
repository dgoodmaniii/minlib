.SH NAME
minlib \- a text-based library management program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minlib
[\fB\-r\fR \fIformatstring\fR]
[\fB\-f\fR \fIinputfile[,...]\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B minlib
A text-based library management program, designed to do one
thing---manage your library, physical and digital---and do
it well. Customizable formatting, usable with books, files,
movies, music or any other media.  Features include
filtering, searching, and more.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-V
Print version and licensing information, then exit
successfully.
.TP
.BR "\-a \fIfile/directory\fR"
Asks \fBminlib\fR to explore some files and output their
metadata in a form suitable for inclusion in a \fBminlib\fR
database.  This will be outputted to stdout, so you can
redirect it to a file as you will.  If you give
\fIfilename\fR as an argument, \fBminlib\fR will output only
the metadata for that file; if you give \fIdirectory\fR as
an argument, \fBminlib\fR will descend recursively through
that directory, outputting metadata for every suitable file
it can find.  Very useful for combing your directory tree
for files that you probably want in your library, but don't
want to manually enter the information for.  Works for
\fIpdf\fR and \fIepub\fR files.
.PP
.RS
Be aware that an error on any one file while traveling the
tree will stop \fBminlib\fR entirely; this is in keeping
with the "when you must fail, fail as soon and as noisily
as possible" principle.  You may have to move the
troublesome file from the tree if you can't resolve the
issue.
.PP
Supported file types for automatically extracting metadata
are pdf, epub, html, ps, dvi, doc(x), xls(x), ppt(x), ogv,
ogg, mp3, man, sxw, sdw, flac, wav, s3m, xm, it, nsf(e),
sid, exiv2, jpeg, gif, png, tiff, deb, rpm, tar(.gz), lzh,
lha, rar, zip, cab, 7-zip, ar, mtree, pax, cpio, iso9660,
share, raw, xar flv, real, riff (avi), mpeg, qt, and asf.
Other than pdf and epub, GNU libextractor governs this
extraction; pdf uses pdfinfo, and epub is done internally.
.PP
Mobi and other Kindle-type formats will work with
\fBminlib\fR in general, but \fBminlib\fR cannot extract
metadata from them; they're just too locked-down for me to
figure out.
.RE
.TP
.BR "\-f \fIfilename\fR"
Use \fIfilename\fR as the source of library records.  You
can supply a comma-separated list of source files in this
argument, and \fBminlib\fR will do the right thing and use
them all, by dumping them all into a temporary file and then
inputting that.
.TP
.BR "\-r \fIrecord-format\fR"
Use \fIrecord-format\fR as the format for each individual
record outputted by \fBminlib\fR.  By default, this is
\fB%29t | %20L | %10F | %4l | %4g\fR, which the astute
reader will see adds to precisely the default terminal width
of 80 characters.  The format is similar to that of C's
printf, in that we use a percent sign, followed by a number,
followed by a single character which specifies what to fill
in, but it is quite different from that of C's printf in
that it requires that each formatting character be
accompanied by a number of characters.  Given the extreme
variability of field lengths, and the extreme limitation of
most terminals, this restriction seems reasonable.

up that field with spaces.
.RE
.SH FILES
\fBminlib\fR uses two files primarily:  the data, or library
file, which has the actual library information in it, and a
run-control, or config file, which contains simple lines to
control \fBminlib\fR's behavior.
.SS The Data File
The data file, or library file, is a pretty simple "cookie
jar" format, consisting of multi-line records separated by
lines containing two percentage marks, or (\fB%%\fR).  No
line can contain the text "\fB%%\fR" except record
separating lines; \fBminlib\fR will always consider such
lines to be starting a new record.
.PP
\fBPlease note that every record requires a %% to begin it,
including the first in a file.\fR
.PP
Between each record-separating line are the individual
fields of the record.  These consist of a field name in all
capital letters, a colon, and then the text of the field.
After the colon, whitespace can be inserted or deleted at
will, with no change in how \fBminlib\fR reads the line.
Each field must be contained entirely on one line, however.
.PP
An example record:
.RS

MEDIA:  book
.RE
You then repeat this as many times as you need to to build
your library database.
.PP
Because \fBminlib\fR accepts multiple files at the same
time, you can divide your library files however you wish,
and \fBminlib\fR will accept whichever files you specify,
sort them all together, and display them to you.  So you can
have one file with your books, one with your movies, one
with your music, and one with your vintage 8-tracks of
original Swedish ABBA and still get them all at once if you
want.
.PP
There are no artificial limits on the fields you can
include; if you particular library database requires "FOO"
as a field, just put it in there.  \fBminlib\fR will not be
able to sort your records by fields it doesn't know;
however, it will be able to search for such fields, and it
will be able to display such fields in its detail view, when
you select a record.
.PP
For fields that \fBminlib\fR knows, see the section on the
\fB\-r\fR option above.
.PP
It's important to note that options given on the command
line take precedence over conflicting options in the config
file.
.PP
If there is a digital file available, \fBminlib\fR knows one
magic field name:  PATH.  \fBminlib\fR will use the value of
the PATH field to open the file with the appropriate
application.
.SS Run-Control File (Config File)
The run-control file ("rc" or "config" file) contains the
configurable options for \fBminlib\fR to use.  Note that
when options specified on the command line conflict with
those in the config file, the options on the command line
will take precedence.
.PP
.BR Locations
.PP
\fBminlib\fR will take a config file wherever you want it
to, provided that you have read access to that file.  If you
don't provide it a config file, it will attempt to read from
"\fI$HOME/.minlibrc\fR", which, of course, may not exist.
If it can't find that, it will give up and assume you don't
want it to consider a config file.
.PP
.BR Options
.PP
\fBminlib\fR allows you to set defaults for many different
configuration options in your config file.  Most
importantly, these are input files; record format strings;
and default viewers for digital files.  Like the input file
we discussed above, the format is simple:  an all-caps
string which says what option you're trying to set, and then
the value of that option.  Whitespace on the line is
ignored.  So, for example:
.PP
.RS
DEF_PDF_VIEWER:  xpdf -cont "%s"
.br
TOP_FORE_COLOR:  COLOR_BLUE
.br
TOP_BACK_COLOR:  COLOR_YELLOW
.RE
.PP
A \fBminlib\fR rc-file is essentially just a list of lines
of this type.
.PP
Remember to put quotations around the "%s" in your config
file; otherwise, your application will likely choke on
filenames with special characters in them, including spaces.
.PP
The non-color settings available are:
.TP
.BR DEF_PDF_VIEWER
Obviously, the pdf viewer that you'd like \fBminlib\fR to
call when you try to open a pdf file.  Default is \fIxpdf
"%s"\fR.
.TP
.BR DEF_EPUB_VIEWER
The viewer for opening epub files.  Default is \fIfbreader
"%s"\fR.
.TP
.BR DEF_HTML_VIEWER
The viewer for opening HTML files.  Default is \fIw3m
"%s"\fR.
.TP
.BR DEF_OGV_VIEWER
The viewer for opening OGG videos; that is, Theora videos.
Default is \fIvlc "%s"\fR.
.TP
.BR DEF_OGG_VIEWER
The viewer for opening OGG audio; that is, Ogg Vorbis.  Also
applies to Speex (.spx), a codec designed specifically for
human voices.  Default is \fIogg123 "%s"\fR.
.TP
.BR DEF_DVI_VIEWER
The viewer for opening DVI documents; that is, old-style TeX
output files.  Default is \fIxdvi "%s"\fR.
.TP
.BR DEF_PS_VIEWER
The viewer for opening Postscript documents; default is
\fIgs "%s"\fR.
.TP
.BR DEF_OFFICE_VIEWER
The viewer for opening .doc(x), .xls(x), .ppt(x), and their
LibreOffice equivalents.  Default is \fIlibreoffice "%s"\fR.
.PP
.BR Colors
.PP
\fBminlib\fR allows you to set the colors for pretty much
everything in the program.  Normal \fIncurses\fR colors will
be accepted by \fBminlib\fR.  These are \fBCOLOR_BLACK\fR,
\fBCOLOR_RED\fR, \fBCOLOR_GREEN\fR, \fBCOLOR_YELLOW\fR,
\fBCOLOR_BLUE\fR, \fBCOLOR_MAGENTA\fR, \fBCOLOR_CYAN\fR, or
\fBCOLOR_WHITE\fR.
.PP
If you do not set a particular color, \fBminlib\fR will
select a reasonable default for you.  The algorithm for this
is simple:  foreground colors will be set to
\fBCOLOR_WHITE\fR and background colors to
\fBCOLOR_BLACK\fR.  Be aware that, if you set some
foreground colors without setting the corresponding
background colors, these defaults might make your color
scheme illegible.
.PP
The colors that can be set are:
.TP
.BR TOP_FORE_COLOR
The foreground color (that is, the color for the text) in
the top bar.  This is the top bar in both menu view and
detail view.
.TP
.BR TOP_BACK_COLOR
The background color (that is, the color for the background
of the text) in the top bar.  This is the top bar in both
menu view and detail view.
.TP
.BR BOT_FORE_COLOR
The foreground color (that is, the color for the text) in
the bottom bar.  This is the bottom bar in both menu view and
detail view.
.TP
.BR BOT_BACK_COLOR
The background color (that is, the color for the background
of the text) in the bottom bar.  This is the bottom bar in both
menu view and detail view.
.TP
.BR MEN_FORE_COLOR
The foreground color (that is, the color for the text) in the 
menu; this will also be the background color of the
currently active item on the menu.  That is, inactive items
(items the cursor is \fInot\fR on) will have this as the
text color; the active item (the item the cursor \fIis\fR
on) will have this as the background color.
.TP
.BR MEN_BACK_COLOR
The background color (that is, the color for the background
of the text) in the menu; this will also be the text color
of the currently active item on the menu.  That is, inactive
items (items the cursor is \fInot\fR on) will have this as
the background color; the active item (the item the cursor
\fIis\fR on) will have this as the text color.
.TP
.BR DET_FIELD_FORE_COLOR
The foreground color (that is, the color for the text) for
the field names in detail view.
.TP
.BR DET_FIELD_BACK_COLOR
The background color (that is, the color for the background
of the text) for the field names in detail view.
.TP
.BR DET_TXT_FORE_COLOR
The foreground color (that is, the color for the text) for
the field values in detail view.
.TP
.BR DET_TXT_BACK_COLOR
The background color (that is, the color for the background
of the text) for the field values in detail view.
.TP
.BR DET_BACK_COLOR
The background color for the whole window in detail view.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
\fBminlib\fR is likely to be used interactively most of the
time.  Fortunately, this interactive use is extremely
simple.  \fBminlib\fR's interface focuses on two views:
"Menu View" and "Detail View."  Most operations the user
will be likely to want are available to the user in the same
way in both views.
.PP
Which view you are currently using, either menu or detail,
will be noted in the top right corner of the screen.  In
menu view, the top center will show how many records are in
your database; in detail view, the top center will show
which record you're currently viewing the details of.
.PP
\fBMenu view\fR is the default view, and is what you'll be
looking at when you start \fBminlib\fR.  It is, as the name
implies, simply a large menu, with one item for each of the
records in your data file(s).
.PP
\fIScroll down\fR with the down arrow or with 'j'; \fIscroll
up\fR with the up arrow or with 'k'.
.PP
\fISearching\fR can be done in one of two ways.  The
simplest way is termed \fImatching\fR; this simply matches
the first characters from the record.  Hit 'm', then enter
the first few characters you're looking for.  \fBminlib\fR
will then take you to the first record matching those first
few characters.  Hit 'p' for the next matching record, and
hit 'P' for the previous matching record.
.PP
Matching is limited, though, in that it can only match the
first few characters in the record; \fIfull search\fR is
much more powerful.  With full search, you can search the
entirety of your records, not merely the portions visible in
menu view; also, rather than merely character-for-character
matching, you have the full power of regular expressions
available.  Hit '/' to search; \fBminlib\fR will tell you
whether you've found any matches, and if so, how many.  It
will also skip you forward to the first match it finds.  Now
hit 'n' for the next match and 'N' for the previous match.
.PP
When you arrive at the record you're looking for, hit
\fIenter\fR; this will take you to \fIdetail view\fR.
Detail view is your entire record for that entry; it will
display all the fields you've assigned for that entry in
your data file.  If this is too much information for a
single screen, fear not; use the down arrow or 'j' to scroll
down, and use the up arrow or 'k' to scroll up, precisely as
you did in menu view.
.PP
In either menu or detail view, you may want to \fIopen a
file\fR.  If this is a physical item record (e.g., the data
about a book on your shelf), you obviously won't be able to
do this (though trying won't hurt; \fBminlib\fR will
innocently tell you that it can't find a file for that
item); but if it's a digital item, \fBminlib\fR will do its
best to take care of that for you.
.PP
Hit 'o' in either menu or detail view, and the bar at the
bottom of the screen will present you with some options.
Hit the key corresponding to the format you want to open;
e.g., hit 'p' to open a pdf.  If \fBminlib\fR can't find a
file of that format for the record, it will tell you so;
otherwise, it will start the viewer with which you can view
that file.  You can kill \fBminlib\fR while viewing your
file; neither \fBminlib\fR nor your file viewer should care.
.PP

.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBminlib\fR returns 0 if successful, non-zero if it fails
for some reason.  See the \fBERRORS\fR section for possible
failure exit statuses.
.SH ERRORS
\fBminlib\fR can, like all programs, go wrong in a huge
number of ways; but fortunately, most of those are extremely
unlikely.  Still, \fBminlib\fR tries hard to give precise
failure information, even for those situations that
basically never happen.
.PP
So upon failure, \fBminlib\fR prints both an error message
to \fIstderr\fR and exits with a particular status.  Error
codes are as follows:
.TP
.BR 1
You gave \fBminlib\fR an option that it doesn't recognize.
.TP
.BR 2
You supplied \fBminlib\fR an option which requires an
argument, but didn't send it an argument.  E.g., you said
\fB\-r\fR, but didn't say what you wanted the formatting
string to be.
.TP
.BR 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Insufficient memory errors; this are only thrown when the
operating system can't provide enough memory for
\fBminlib\fR to do its thing.  Since \fBminlib\fR doesn't
require much memory, these errors are exceedingly unlikely.
\fB3\fR means it couldn't load the data file; \fB4\fR means
means that it couldn't load the data file into formatted
lines; \fB5\fR means that it couldn't load the array used to
track the formatted lines; \fB6\fR means that it couldn't
get enough memory for the format string; \fB7\fR
indicates insufficient memory for a variety of minor
internal tasks; \fB9\fR means there is insufficient memory
for the filename string.
.TP
.BR 8
A problem opening the data file.  A message printed to
stderr will give the name of the file and the error number.
.TP
.BR 10
A problem opening the config file.  A message printed to
stderr will give the name of the file and the error number.
.TP
.BR 11
\fBminlib\fR has checked in all the usual places (a config
file and the command line), but hasn't found an input file
(that is, a database or library file).  As such, it has
nothing to do and quites.
.TP
.BR 12
\fBminlib\fR uses temporary files to process multiple input
files.  However, it's been unable to construct such a
temporary file.  Check your permissions to resolve this.
.TP
.BR 13
You've asked \fBminlib\fR to print the metadata of a file
with the "\fB\-a\fR" option; however, it's having some
trouble getting information about that file.  The
specific error message printed will tell you more.
.TP
.BR 14
You've asked \fBminlib\fR to print the metadata of a file
with the "\fB\-a\fR" option; however, it's having some
trouble opening that file.  Probably a permissions issue;
the specific error message printed will tell you more.
