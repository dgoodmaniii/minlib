<h1>Why Minlib?</h1>

<h2>or, Why not just use calibre?</h2>

<p><span class="fl">M</span>inlib's only real competitor is
calibre.  Calibre has a number of shortcomings when compared
to minlib:</p> <ul> <li>Speed.  Calibre is an
<em>enormous</em> application (over sixty megabytes even in
its smaller versions, according to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibre_(software)">Wikipedia</a>),
and it is written primarily in Python.  While Python is
annoying to me for many reasons (not least of all that
absurd white-space critical rule, where tabs are different
from an equivalent number of spaces), it's also rather slow
for larger applications, and calibre (despite having bits in
C++) shows this.  Minlib, on the other hand, is
<em>very</em> fast, being written entirely in C.</li>

<li>Size.  As mentioned above, calibre is <em>huge</em>.
Minlib, on the other hand, weighs in at under one hundred
K.</li>

<li>Calibre is pretty fascistic; as far as calibre is
concerned, it knows what to do, and you don't.
For example, calibre requires that you store your books in
<em>its</em> way, not your way.  Consider the question in
the <a
href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/faq.html#why-doesn-t-calibre-let-me-store-books-in-my-own-directory-structure">FAQ</a>:
<blockquote>
The whole point of calibre's library management features is
that they provide a search and sort based interface for
locating books that is <em>much</em> more efficient than any
possible directory scheme you could come up with for your
collection.  Indeed, once you become comfortable using
calibre's interface to find, sort and browse your
collection, you wont [sic] ever feel the need to hunt
through the files on your disk to find a book again.
</blockquote>
In other words, "<em>I</em> know how you should be storing
your library; <em>you</em> don't.  <em>Your</em> way is no
good; <em>my</em> way is the One True Way.  If you don't
like this way, you just aren't trying hard enough."  I don't
agree with this way of looking at things; this is one of the
major reasons I decided I needed to write minlib, for my own
purposes if for no one else's.</li>
</ul>

<p>So minlib tries to take the opposite tack:  it's written
in a fast language, it's quite small, and it lets you store
your media wherever and however you like.  Minlib assumes
that you know what you're doing and works around you; it
doesn't assume that you don't, and force you to work the way
it wants.</p>
