<p><span class="fl">B</span>ecause those wishing to email
the Webmaster have probably found some problem with the
design or function of the site, that same Webmaster has
elected to explain his basic design philosophies here, so
that perhaps some perceived problems will actually be found
to be virtues of superior web design (!).  However, on the
off (again, !) chance that some real bug has appeared
despite a great deal of testing, the manner of contacting
the Webmaster has been included at the bottom.</p>

<h3>Design Techniques</h3>

<h4>Issues of Media</h4>

<p>I am firmly convinced that the Internet medium is
<em>not</em> the same as print.  While it certainly bears
some similarity to print in many ways, it is a different
medium and must therefore be treated differently.
Similarities include the existence of text; the organization
of that text into lines and paragraphs; often, the ordering
of paragraphs into sections and subsections; and others
which are doubtlessly important but do not require
mentioning.  Differences, however, include the lack of page
breaks, and consequently the absence of a distinction
between verso and recto pages; the lack of necessity for
running headers or footers; the removal of the danger of a
paragraph break coinciding with a page break, thus not
requiring indentation of new paragraphs and making increased
spacing between paragraphs a practical and useful option;
the luminosity of the screen, as opposed to the reflective
nature of a paper page; and many others.  This means that
the design of the site for screen viewing, undoubtedly its
primary medium, must be different from its design on the
printed page.</p>

<p>The differences in design will mostly be obvious, when
the differences of the medium are remembered.  I have
already mentioned the differences in paragraph breaking;
rather than indenting and not increasing the space, useful
in a book when otherwise a page break after a period would
produce an ambiguous paragraph break, I have followed the
HTML standard and simply increased the spacing between
paragraphs.  Since there are no page breaks, no confusion
should result.  The luminosity of the screen is a harder nut
to crack; this resulted in the use of an off-white for the
background, a straight white being too bright and very hard
on the eyes.  A darker background in a printed book,
however, would be most irritating, and make the book much
more difficult to read.  I have simply eliminated running
headers and footers, since the title bar of the browser
provides a perfectly effective and universally supported way
of reminding people what page they are viewing, should they
pay so little attention that they forget.  I have, however,
included a more obvious title bar at the top of each page
and a link to the home at both top (the logo with the
picture of little St. Maria) and bottom to facilitate
navigation.  Furthermore, near the top of each page I have
provided a tool bar with links to all of the likely-visited
sites; those likely to be more rarely sought (really, just
this page, though others are linked there) I have limited to
the bottom of the <a href="index.html">main page</a>.
Navigation should therefore be easy and straight-forward,
and reading, even long-term, should not present abnormal
difficulty.</p>

<p>The similarities in design may not be so obvious, but
being a good traditionalist I have endeavored not to alter
the lessons of biquennia of printing experience
unless necessitated by the two dozen or so years of Web
publishing savvy that I've tried to absorb.  One of these
lessons, which most Web designers completely ignore, is the
desirability of certain fonts.  Namely, <em>serif</em>
fonts.  Serif fonts are easier to read; they pull words
together much more effectively than sans-serif, and
consequently I've selected them as my choice in all
situations, even those in which conventional wisdom (and,
admittedly, printing experience) permit, but do not require,
sans-serif.  Another peeve of mine, also widely ignored
throughout the Web, is text justification.  Flush-left is
great for headings and all, but text ought to be justified
on both sides, not ragged-right.  Experience tells us that
justified text is easier to read; the line length is
consistent and therefore the mind can unconsciously recall
how much of it is left before shifting to the next line is
required, which allows him to speed up his reading
accordingly.  Admittedly, text is not so beautiful justified
in browsers as it is with a quality typesetting system, such
as <a href="http://www.ctan.org">TeX and LaTeX</a>;
ligatures and automatic word-spacing controls just haven't
entered the collective Web consciousness yet.  But it's
still much better than the often grotesquely inconsistent
line length of ragged-right text, and CSS offers a very easy
and reasonably effective way of doing it.  So I've selected
that option.</p>

<p>I selected HTML5 as my markup of choice.</p>

<p>So despite this relatively progressive stance in my
markup, I think that I can still hold my head up high and
deliver the following diatribe on contemporary web design
with a straight and dignified face.</p>

<h4>Rants on the Downfall of the Web</h4>

<p>In all cases I have attempted to produce a site which is
simply designed and easily used and navigated.  A number of
unfortunately common web accessories have come to interfere
with that simple, pristine goal which once animated the
entirety of the Internet.  Among these are JavaScript, Flash
animations, frames, tabular formatting of non-tabular data,
and doubtlessly other, even more offensive monstrosities.
While high-speed Internet access is fast becoming the
standard, these toys seem to be useful primarily for slowing
down the loading of the site.  Furthermore, they
unnecessarily obfuscate the code, making maintenance far
more time-consuming and expensive than it needs to be, and
it creates insuperable difficulties for those who still
prefer to surf the Web using text-only browsers like Lynx,
and for those who are forced to do so using aural browsers
(the blind).  Dane Weber, a good friend of mine, has
produced a wonderful <a
href="http://dane.weber.org/frames/">example</a> of the
JavaScript/frames problem; I encourage everyone who doubts
this admittedly harsh condemnation to view it before making
a judgement (though note that it is nearly impossible to
back out of this example, providing yet another reason not
to use the various tricks it employs, so unless you're using
some outdated and badly designed browser it's probably best
to enter it in a different tab).</p>

<p>While I do not, of course, have any problem with Flash,
JavaScript, or tables for certain purposes, I simply refuse
to use them for purposes for which they were not designed.
I do not like pop-ups or any of the other eye-candy which
JavaScript offers, and consequently I have limited the
visual techno-shows on the site to what is available with
basic <a href="http://www.w3.org">HTML5 and CSS</a>, the
tools which could, if they become standard, make the Web
what it was supposed to be:  an open forum for easy and
straightforward information exchange.  Flash is a wonderful
tool, where it belongs; I very much enjoy <a
href="http://www.homestarrunner.com">certain Flash
creations</a> and would not want to eliminate the animation
language entirely.  However, using Flash to animate menus
and other design toys is a.) cheating in order to compensate
for a probably lousy design, and b.) incredibly difficult
for those mentioned above (text-only and blind surfers), and
c.) unnecessary complication for generally very simple
tasks.  They slow down the loading of the site on top of all
that.  As for tables, I use them myself---for tabular data.
They're great if you want to provide a table of prices, or
rates of cancer increase, or other types of usually
numerical data.  They're also wonderful for grammatical
charts (<i>pass&eacute; compos&eacute;</i>, anyone?), and
doubtlessly many other uses.  But they're <em>not meant for
formatting a web page</em>.  <a
href="http://www.w3.org">CSS</a> provides an easy,
unambiguous, and standards-compliant way to do anything that
tabular formatting can possibly do, and to do it without
causing problems for certain viewers.  Before CSS I could
tolerate such things; afterward there is no excuse.  And
frames?  They were never useful; tabular formatting was much
better even before CSS, and now they're simply a bane of
every surfer's existence.  What little good they could ever
do is now gone.</p>

<p>I have therefore avoided complicated JavaScript, Flash
animations, frames, and even tabular formatting except for
tabular data.  The XHTML is written simply and as portably
as possible, and as much formatting as possible is done via
cascading style sheets, all of which conforms to industry
standards.  This site was written in accord with industry
standards, and has passed the <a
href="http://validator.w3.org">w3 validation tests</a>.
Therefore, it should be as easily viewed in one browser as
in any other, and its appearance across all browsers and
systems should be more or less uniform.  Alas, however, the
world is not a perfect place.</p>

<h3>Browser Issues</h3>

<p>That said, the reality is not as pristine as it should
be, partly because <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com">certain companies</a>
persistently refuse to write software that reliably conforms
to industry standards.  This makes certain styling measures
somewhat, shall we say, inconsistent.  Some browsers, on the
other hand, are exemplary in their conformity to those
standards, and one such was therefore used in the
development of this site.  The browser used for testing the
site was <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Mozilla
Firefox</a>, an open-source browser whose development is
directed by <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a>.
This browser is, therefore, doubtlessly the best with which
to view this site.</p>

<p>Otherwise, however, there should be no problems viewing
the site.  Lynx shouldn't be (too) upset by the formatting,
done as it is by CSS, which Lynx (as far as I know) does not
support.  Old browsers which don't support CSS should not
have a problem; I've viewed the pages without the stylesheet
and, while the appearance is not so beautiful and
well-designed (!), it's still acceptable and legible.  If
anyone does have trouble with any particular browser or
tool, please let me know and I will do whatever I can to
correct it, even if (as may well be the case) the fault is
the browser's and not mine.</p>

<p>The site is also what is euphemistically called
<i>mobile-friendly</i>; that is, it's designed to degrade
gracefully when subjected to the limited viewing
environment offered by mobile browsers.  Primarily, this is
done with a meta viewport; but also elements are sized
relative to other elements, or in pixels, so that the page
being squashed to cell-phone sizes will still at least be
legible and usable, even if not  particularly pretty.
Google's test assures me that the site is mobile-friendly;
but if you notice any problems with the site on small-form
devices, please let me know.</p>

<h3>Any Remaining Bugs</h3>

<p>Despite my best efforts, however, certain bugs
undoubtedly appear in certain circumstances, and
consequently I, the Webmaster, wish to make myself available
for reports of those bugs.  Even that, however, must be more
complicated than it has to be.  I have been forced by the
spamming industry to provide a spamproof method of
contacting me by e-mail.  Simply type in the address that
you see garbled and mangled in the image below and I should
get your report.  Please let me know if there are any
problems regarding downloading, broken links, or anything
else on the site.  If, in particular, you happen to
authenticate the site on a whim and find that a page is not
standards compliant, let me know; I will be appropriately
shocked and immediately remedy the problem.</p>

<p><img src="webmas.png" alt="webmaster's email" /><br
/></p>

<p>If you have trouble reading the garbled and mangled image
to the left, or you just can't view it (you have turned
images off on your browser, or are heroically using a
text-only browser like Lynx), you can enter in the address
which I will (gorpub) be working (at) in ever so stealthily
(gmail) throughout (dot) this paragraph (com).  It is sad
that spammers' ingenuity has outstripped all less
distasteful methods of providing an email address.  Thank
you for your time in reporting errors in the site design and
function, and I hope minlib and this site are useful to
you.</p>
