<h1>Minlib Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">A</span>s with any piece of unfamiliar
software, it takes some time to get used to minlib.
However, despite its power as a library management program,
it's pretty simple to operate, and it won't take very long
to be using it with ease.</p>

<p>To get started, you'll need to have at your disposal a
command line.  While minlib doesn't require you to work with
it on the command line (that's what its text user interface,
or TUI, is for), the command line is the normal way to start
it up.  We will use 

<pre class="demo">$></pre>

to show the command prompt, and the following line (if any)
will be the output that minlib produces.  You are supposed
to type what appears on the line after the prompt.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started using minlib, you'll really only need one
thing:  a <em>data file</em>.  This is the file that minlib
uses to form its list of your library, making all the useful
features of minlib possible.  It's so important, in fact,
that minlib is entirely useless without one, and if you
don't provide it with one, minlib will simply let you know
that it doesn't have anything to work with, and will
quit:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$>  minlib
minlib:  no input file specified
</pre>

<p>So you need to give minlib something to work with; you
need to give it your data file.  You can do this in one of
two ways.  Let's take a common use case:  you're trying to
convert your library over from calibre.  Unlike calibre,
minlib does not force you to store your files in a
particular way; so converting your calibre use to minlib is
a simple matter:  use the "<strong>-a</strong>" option.
Take note of whatever directory you told calibre to use for
storing your books.  Then enter the following:

<pre class="demo">
$>  minlib -a /your/book/directory > library_file
metadata.db not a minlib format; skipping...
Processing mybook.pdf...
Processing mybook.epub...
Processing mybook_1.html...
Processing mybook_2.html...
Processing mybook_3.html...
....
</pre>

And so on.  Depending on the size of your library, this may
take a while to run; but minlib will provide you plenty of
output to let you know what it's doing.  All of that
feedback about what minlib is doing will be output to
"stderr," so you'll be able to watch what minlib is doing;
but the actual metadata from your files is written to
"stdout," so once minlib is finished, you'll find your data
file in "<strong>library_file</strong>.</p>

<p>If you open <strong>library_file</strong>, it will look
something like this:</p>

<p>Depicted above are two <em>records</em>, each of which
lists the metadata for one book.  All of this information,
except the line labelled "<strong>PATH</strong>", comes
directly from the files themselves; the
<strong>PATH</strong> line is supplied by minlib.  Of
course, minlib will traverse the entire directory tree and
do this for all the files in formats it recognizes; other
files it will simply ignore.</p>

<p>Each record is separated from the ones above and below it
by a line containing "<strong>%%</strong>"; even the first
record must begin with this line, but the last record does
not need to be followed by it.  Each line consists of a
<em>field name</em>, which is a series of all-caps (and
optionally periods) closed by a colon, followed by either
nothing or any amount of whitespace, followed by the
<em>field data</em>, which is arbitrary information which
consists of the rest of the line.  The field data can be of
any length; our second record shows an abnormally long title
(beginning with "Choregraphie"), but the field data has no
length limit at all.</p>

<p>In any case, now you have your data file (at least one;
it's likely you'll wind up with several as time goes on,
each containing different types of media; but you may choose
to keep them all in one, if you wish); now try running:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$> minlib -f library_file
</pre>

<p>Now, minlib will start up, looking something like
this:</p>
