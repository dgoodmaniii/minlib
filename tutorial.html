<h1>Minlib Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">A</span>s with any piece of unfamiliar
software, it takes some time to get used to minlib.
However, despite its power as a library management program,
it's pretty simple to operate, and it won't take very long
to be using it with ease.</p>

<p>To get started, you'll need to have at your disposal a
command line.  While minlib doesn't require you to work with
it on the command line (that's what its text user interface,
or TUI, is for), the command line is the normal way to start
it up.  We will use 

<pre class="demo">$></pre>

to show the command prompt, and the following line (if any)
will be the output that minlib produces.  You are supposed
to type what appears on the line after the prompt.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started using minlib, you'll really only need one
thing:  a <em>data file</em>.  This is the file that minlib
uses to form its list of your library, making all the useful
features of minlib possible.  It's so important, in fact,
that minlib is entirely useless without one, and if you
don't provide it with one, minlib will simply let you know
that it doesn't have anything to work with, and will
quit:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$>  minlib
minlib:  no input file specified
</pre>

<p>So you need to give minlib something to work with; you
need to give it your data file.  You can do this in one of
two ways.  Let's take a common use case:  you're trying to
convert your library over from calibre.  Unlike calibre,
minlib does not force you to store your files in a
particular way; so converting your calibre use to minlib is
a simple matter:  use the "<strong>-a</strong>" option.
Take note of whatever directory you told calibre to use for
storing your books.  Then enter the following:

<pre class="demo">
$>  minlib -a /your/book/directory > library_file
metadata.db not a minlib format; skipping...
Processing mybook.pdf...
Processing mybook.epub...
Processing mybook_1.html...
Processing mybook_2.html...
Processing mybook_3.html...
....
</pre>

And so on.  Depending on the size of your library, this may
take a while to run; but minlib will provide you plenty of
output to let you know what it's doing.  All of that
feedback about what minlib is doing will be output to
"stderr," so you'll be able to watch what minlib is doing;
but the actual metadata from your files is written to
"stdout," so once minlib is finished, you'll find your data
file in "<strong>library_file</strong>.</p>

<p>If you open <strong>library_file</strong>, it will look
something like this:</p>

<p>Depicted above are two <em>records</em>, each of which
lists the metadata for one book.  All of this information,
except the line labelled "<strong>PATH</strong>", comes
directly from the files themselves; the
<strong>PATH</strong> line is supplied by minlib.  Of
course, minlib will traverse the entire directory tree and
do this for all the files in formats it recognizes; other
files it will simply ignore.</p>

<p>Each record is separated from the ones above and below it
by a line containing "<strong>%%</strong>"; even the first
record must begin with this line, but the last record does
not need to be followed by it.  Each line consists of a
<em>field name</em>, which is a series of all-caps (and
optionally periods) closed by a colon, followed by either
nothing or any amount of whitespace, followed by the
<em>field data</em>, which is arbitrary information which
consists of the rest of the line.  The field data can be of
any length; our second record shows an abnormally long title
(beginning with "Choregraphie"), but the field data has no
length limit at all.</p>

<p>In any case, now you have your data file (at least one;
it's likely you'll wind up with several as time goes on,
each containing different types of media; but you may choose
to keep them all in one, if you wish); now try running:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$> minlib -f library_file
</pre>

And we'll see what happens then in our next section.

<h2>Running Minlib</h2>

<p>Having run the last-listed command above, minlib will
start itself up and show you the listings of your library.
By default, it looks something like this:</p>

<img class="sshot" src="initial_shot.png" />

<p>(We say "by default" because the colors and format are
extremely customizable, about which we'll see more later.
But the above is what minlib does unless you tell it to do
otherwise.)</p>

<p>Let's look at that image above for a moment.  The line at
the very bottom, with blue text, is immaterial; it is simply
a function of the author's totally unrelated configuration
of GNU screen.  But we can see several important parts of
the screen that minlib presents to you above, each of which
serves a different function.</p>

<img class="sshot" src="labelled_diagram.png" />

<p>The <em>top bar</em> provides you the name and version of
the program; the total number of records that minlib
currently has loaded; and identifies that you are in
<em>menu view</em> (as opposed to <em>detail view</em>,
which is reached by hitting "enter" on one of the menu
options).  The <em>bottom bar</em> lists your options for
actions, and is relatively self-explanatory.  Then there are
the <em>menu options</em>, which is the list of records in
your library; scroll up or down to see more.  Finally, there
is the <em>cursor</em>, which highlights the
currently-selected item; in this case, Orwell's
<em>1984</em>.</p>

<p>You can move around in menu view in the following
ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Scroll up and down</em>:  use either your up and
down arrow keys, or use 'j' for down and 'k' for up.</li>
<li><em>Page up and down</em>:  use the "Page Up" and "Page
Down" keys to scroll up and down by a page at a time.</li>
<li><em>Menu up and down</em>:  you can skip straight to the
top or bottom of the menu view by using the "Home" and "End"
keys on your keyboard.</li>
<li><em>Match</em>:  you can do a quick and simple matching
of records.  In the default view, for example, you can find
<em>1984</em> easily by simply typing 'm', then entering the
first few characters in the title.  There may be more than
one match; if that's so, use 'p' to find the next match, or
'P' (capital 'p') to find the previous one.</li>
<li><em>Search</em>:  you can do full record searches of
your entire library.  Hit '/' (forward slash), then type in
the text you want to find.  You can enter any
POSIX-compliant regular expression here; if you don't know
what that means, don't worry about it, and just know that
you can match text anywhere in the library.  There may be
more than one match; if that's so, use 'n' to find the next
match, or 'N' (capital 'n') to find the previous one.</li>
</ul>
