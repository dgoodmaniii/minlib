<h1>Downloading and Installing Minlib</h1>

<p><span class="fl">D</span>ownloading and installing minlib
is a pretty straightforward process; the program was
designed to be easily built and installed.  So presuming
that you don't have a prebuilt version for your
distribution, you can read through this page.</p>

<h2>Downloading Minlib</h2>

<p>The minlib source is all available at Github:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://www.github.com/dgoodmaniii/minlib/">Minlib
Source</a>
</center>

<p>Github is pretty daunting for people who don't know <a
href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>, so a little explanation
of this page is in order.  If all you want to do is download
the program to install, head to the "<strong>Clone or
download</strong>" button on the right, which will give you
the option of downloading a zip archive:</p>

<center>
<a
href="https://github.com/dgoodmaniii/minlib/archive/master.zip">zip
of minlib</a>
</center>

<p>If you <em>do</em> happen to know <a
href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>, then go ahead and work
your magic; clone that repository to your heart's
content.</p>

<h2>Installing Minlib</h2>

<p>This should also be pretty simple, even simpler than
usual, since minlib does not include the usual "./configure"
step that most source downloads do.  I'll be assuming here
that you're working with the zip archive, since anyone who
knows enough <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> to clone
the repository will be able to figure out the rest for
themselves.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the directory you want to put minlib into, and go
to it.</li>
<li>Unzip the archive:
<pre class="demo">
unzip master.zip
</pre>
</li>
<li>Go to the directory that said unzipping created.  It
will be immediately beneath the directory that you
created.</li>
<li>Build the source:
<pre class="demo">
make
</pre>
</li>
<li>You now have a working minlib in this directory.
Probably, however, you want more than that:  you want to be
able to run minlib from any directory, read the manpage when
you need to, and so forth.  So become root however you
normally would (<strong>sudo</strong>, or <strong>su
-</strong>, or whatever), and run the following:
<pre class="demo">
make install
</pre>
That should cover it; you've now got minlib running on your
computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you need help learning to run minlib, visit the <a
href="ml_docs.html">documentation</a> page, especially the
<a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.  And then, happy
managing!</p>
